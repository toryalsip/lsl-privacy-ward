### LSL Privacy Ward

Sometimes you just want to be left alone and you don't want harassers to creep around in your parcel, so this script accomplishes this. It by default does not eject an avatar that is moving, but will eject them if they stop.

Inspired by the [Magic Ward of Privacy Scroll](https://marketplace.secondlife.com/p/Magic-Ward-of-Privacy-Scroll/25771165) from [Otoa Kyori](https://marketplace.secondlife.com/stores/253911).
